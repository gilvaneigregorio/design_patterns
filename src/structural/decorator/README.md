# Description
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Also know as Wrapper.

# Wikipedia says
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
